## Hello and Welcome!

I'm thrilled you're here! My name is Pooja Khanal, and I hail from the beautiful and diverse country of Nepal. Professionally, I've carved a niche for myself as a Software QA Engineer, where I merge my analytical skills with my passion for technology. But beyond the codes and test cases, there's another side to me that craves adventure and exploration.

### My Passion for Travel

Travel is not just a hobby for me; it's a way of life. I've always been mesmerized by the vastness and variety of our planet. My greatest adventure so far? Exploring 32 national parks across the United States. Each park has its own unique story, and wandering through them has given me a deeper appreciation for nature's wonders. From the serene landscapes to the thrilling wildlife encounters, these journeys have been nothing short of transformative.


### Why I Write

This website is a canvas for my dual passions: technology and travel. It's a place where I share my experiences, insights, and stories. I believe that through sharing, we not only relive our adventures but also inspire others to explore their own paths.

So, whether you're here for tech insights or travel tales, I hope you find something that resonates with you. Let's embark on this journey together, discovering new places, new technologies, and new perspectives!
