After surviving a Chicago winter, I think it’s safe to say I’m officially a local. While I love discovering new spots around the city, what I enjoy even more is finding cool places to take photos! Chicago is a photographer’s (or in my case, a photo-taker’s) dream.

Whether you're here for a day or have been around for a while, grab a friend, or set up your tripod and capture some amazing shots in the Windy City!

Here is my list so far. Don’t forget to enjoy the stroll while you navigate to these places. 


### 1. **Chicago Theater**

### 8. **Bridges and space after bridges**  

My top pick? DuSable Bridge. The view here is unbeatable— Chicago’s skyline, the river, and the city's energy all in one frame.
Right after the bridge, as you head down to the Riverwalk, you’ll find even more great spots. Chicago’s many bridges all make stunning photo backdrops. Find your favorite and strike a pose!
