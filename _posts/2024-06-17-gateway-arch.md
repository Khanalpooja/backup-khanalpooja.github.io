Last weekend, my husband playfully teased me for planning yet another weekend trip that involved over 15 hours of driving. That moment made me realize just how many of our weekends have been packed with long drives. This sparked the idea to share these experiences with others who also thrive on the thrill of travel and the joy of discovering new places on the go.

For those unfamiliar, traveling in the USA often means relying heavily on a car—public transportation options can be limited, depending on where you are. While I have quite a few thoughts on the need for better public transit in the US, perhaps that's a topic best saved for another blog post. For now, let’s dive into the joys and challenges of road tripping across this vast country.

First, Llet me define what a weekend means to me—a span of 2-3 days, usually without taking official vacation days from work. Thanks to a hybrid work schedule, I've had the flexibility to work from almost anywhere some days, which has allowed me to blend travel with my daily responsibilities seamlessly. 

The travel bug in me is relentless, always pushing me to discover new places and seize every chance to explore. I'll share tips from my day-to-day travels and my most recent adventures, with a special love for the national parks across the USA. Over the years, I've embarked on numerous national park trips, mostly involving camping, and each one has been incredible. Let’s talk about what I did, what I would do differently on future visits, and how you can tailor your travel pace and preferences—whether you're like me, always on the move, or prefer to take it slow and soak in each moment. From solo trips to journeys with my husband and close-knit circle of friends, each adventure has its own unique flavor and lessons learned. 


Join me as I share my whirlwind travel experiences. Balancing full-time work with a passion for travel is no small feat, and honestly, it's not for everyone. My trips, often packed into weekends or slightly longer spans, are fast-paced by necessity—we have a lot of ground to cover, and there's no time to waste! Now that I'm on a break, I've had the opportunity to reflect on these experiences. Dive into my itineraries, explore the Google Maps routes I've charted, and check out my budgeting strategies for each journey. I also have a gift - I can fall asleep anywhere. My friends, who often host me, understand my need for these brief escapes—they're weekend warriors themselves, so it works out well for everyone and keeps our friendships strong.



Gateway Arch National Park 
I had an intriguing experience visiting Gateway Arch National Park in Feb 2023, which got me thinking about the nature of national parks. Typically, I expect national parks to be vast expanses of natural beauty, but Gateway Arch had a different vibe with its profound historical significance.
The park is straightforward to visit and doesn't require much planning. It's ideal if you're looking to tick it off your list of national parks to visit. My trip was actually dual-purpose; I aimed to visit all the U.S. national parks and also catch up with friends in different parts of Missouri. The Gateway Arch was just one part of my broader itinerary.
My Itinerary: I worked in the office in person until about 4 PM on Thursday , then my husband and I drove for about 7.5 hours to our friend's place in Edwardsville, IL. Managing time zones was crucial! We took a few breaks, totaling about 45 minutes. We reached his place around 11 and still managed to have yummy home cooked dinner and finish a 2 hour movie. Tough night, right there! Then the sleep deprived me worked remotely on Friday. After 4 PM CDT on Friday (mind the time zone ), we started our weekend adventure officially.  
The next day, we set out to explore the city further and drove to Fulton, MO to reconnect with some friends. Our journey included a visit to the Gateway Arch, where we took the tram up. Despite the cramped conditions and the rush, the ascent was well worth it. The historical displays and the museum below were utterly fascinating, offering a deeper understanding of the site's significance. Although the area was crowded, the $15 tram fee proved to be a good value, especially as it led to a breathtaking sunset view from the top. Interestingly, after our visit, I discovered that the old capitol building I had admired is also part of the national park, adding another layer to our experience. As we explored, we found ourselves questioning why the Gateway Arch is designated as a national park rather than a national monument, a thought that stayed with us as we enjoyed the museum's rich exhibits.
That evening, we celebrated a friend's birthday, which added a festive note to our trip.  The next day brought another adventure—a road trip within our road trip! We spent more time exploring St. Louis, including a visit to the city's exceptional zoo. Remarkably, admission is free, and it offers an unforgettable encounter with a polar bear, viewed safely behind glass. It's easily one of the best zoos I've ever visited.
Continuing our journey, we met more friends and drove about three hours to Fulton, then ventured into downtown Jefferson City to explore the Missouri State Capitol. The architecture of the capitol building is always a highlight for me, and it did not disappoint—exploring it was a delight. 
That night, we stayed in Fulton, where we indulged in delicious homemade biryani and margaritas—a truly delightful evening. As Sunday dawned, so did a slight hangover, but with a nine-hour drive ahead of us, we gathered our spirits. After packing our bags and bidding a warm farewell to Fulton, we headed to Edwardsville to pick up our car. Then, we embarked on the long, tiring drive back home, filled with memories of a fantastic weekend.

What I Missed: I'm an optimistic planner, always thinking there's more time to explore. I had hoped to visit the Ozarks, but time didn't allow. 
What We Ate: We relished a delightful feast that weekend, including fantastic homemade biryanis and margaritas, freshly made momo, delicious street-style pizza, and the rich, comforting taste of Lakota Coffee. It was a culinary adventure that added an extra layer of joy to our gathering. 
Expenses:
Gas: $200 (We left our car in Edwardsville and carpooled to Missouri.)
Gateway Arch: $30 for two, Remember you don’t need to have a national park pass for Gateway Arch. 
Food: $300 (This included groceries for meals and drinks at home; eating pizza, coffee etc.)
In total, we spent about $500 for the two of us over the weekend. 
Travel Route:

Although we visited in February, the park is accessible year-round. However, if adding a trip to the Ozarks, summer is preferable to avoid severe weather.
Total Driving done for the weekend:  Almost 20 hours :) 
Season And Driving Condition:
We did this trip in February but apart from extreme weather(heart storms or blizzard), it is pretty doable year round. But if you want to add ozark, go there in summer.  
Final Thoughts: While Gateway Arch may feel more like a national monument than a park, the experience is unique and memorable, especially when combined with other local attractions.
For anyone planning a visit, I highly recommend integrating other activities or visits into your itinerary. For us, the mix of zoo visits, catching up with friends, and touring significant local landmarks made for a fulfilling, though certainly tiring, weekend.
