## Introduction
I had an intriguing experience visiting Gateway Arch National Park in February 2023, which prompted me to reflect on the nature of national parks. Unlike the vast expanses of natural beauty typically associated with national parks, Gateway Arch offers a unique vibe with its profound historical significance.

## Ease of Visit
The park is straightforward to visit and doesn't require much planning, making it ideal for those looking to quickly tick it off their list of national parks.

## Itinerary Details
My trip was dual-purpose: I aimed to visit all the U.S. national parks and also catch up with friends in various parts of Missouri. Here's how my weekend unfolded:

- **Thursday Afternoon:** Worked in office until about 4 PM, then drove approximately 7.5 hours to Edwardsville, IL, with my husband.
- **Thursday Night:** Arrived at our friend's place around 11 PM, enjoyed a home-cooked dinner, and watched a 2-hour movie.
- **Friday:** Worked remotely until 4 PM CDT, then officially started our weekend adventure.

## Weekend Adventure
- **Saturday:** Explored St. Louis, visiting Gateway Arch and taking the tram up for breathtaking views and historical insights. Despite the crowd and cramped conditions, the $15 tram fee was well worth it.
- **Saturday Evening:** Celebrated a friend's birthday, adding a festive note to our journey.
- **Sunday:** More exploration in St. Louis, including a visit to the exceptional free-entry zoo, featuring a memorable encounter with a polar bear.

## What I Missed
Despite being an optimistic planner, time constraints prevented a visit to the Ozarks.

## Culinary Highlights
We indulged in a variety of delicious foods over the weekend:
- Homemade biryanis and margaritas
- Freshly made momo
- Street-style pizza
- Rich, comforting Lakota Coffee

## Expenses
- **Gas:** $200 (Carpooled to Missouri, leaving our car in Edwardsville)
- **Gateway Arch:** $30 for two (No national park pass needed)
- **Food:** $300 (Included groceries and eating out)
- **Total:** Approximately $500 for the weekend

## Season and Driving Conditions
While we visited in February and the park is accessible year-round, adding a trip to the Ozarks is best in the summer to avoid severe weather.

## Final Thoughts
While Gateway Arch may feel more like a national monument than a park, the experience is unique and memorable. For anyone planning a visit, I highly recommend integrating other activities or visits into your itinerary, as the mix of zoo visits, catching up with friends, and touring significant local landmarks made for a fulfilling, albeit tiring, weekend.
